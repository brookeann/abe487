I had to make a number of corrections to get your code to pass the tests.
It's important to "die" and not just "say/exit" because "die" indicates an
error that should be on STDERR and "say" goes to STDOUT by default.  In the
restriction exercise, it's necessary to remove the spaces before looking 
for the cut sites as you miss one (a newline is inside the sequence).

Two points off.
