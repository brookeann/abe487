         This is fasta file format:
         >seqName description
         ATGGCGTCTTGGCCTTAAAAGCTC
 
5. Without using a text editor examine the contents of the file sequences.fasta.
        - How many lines does this file contain?   

ans: 6

        - How many characters?    (Hint: check out the options of wc)

ans: 370

        - What is the first line of this file?    (Hint: read the man page of head)

ans: >gi|5524211|gb|AAD44166.1| cytochrome b [Elephas maximus maximus]

        - What are the last 3 lines?    (Hint: read the man page of tail)

ans: LLILILLLLLLALLSPDMLGDPDNHMPADPLNTPLHIKPEWYFLFAYAILRSVPNKLGGVLALFLSIVIL
   GLMPFLHTSKHRSMMLRPLSQALFWTLTMDLLTLTWIGSQPVEYPYTIIGQMASILYFSIILAFLPIAGX
   IENY
      
	 - How many sequences are in the file?    (Hint: use grep)
    
ans: 1

6. Rename sequences.fasta to something more informative of the sequences the file contains. (Hint: read the man page for mv)

7. Create a directory called fasta.     (Hint: use mkdir)

8. Copy the fasta file that you renamed to the fasta directory. (Hint: use cp)

9. Verify that the file is within the fasta directory.    (Hint: use ls fasta/)

10. Delete the the original file that you used for copying.    (Hint: use rm, be careful)

11. Read the man page for rm and cp to find out how to remove and copy a directory.

12. Print out your history and redirect it to a file called unixBasics.history.txt
